              The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous identifier, provided by Google Play services. If your device has
              an Advertising ID, we may collect and use it for advertising and user analytics purposes. We may also use
              Apple’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA), which is a non-permanent device identifier provided by Apple, and
              any information obtained through the use of the Advertising Identifier, for the purpose of advertising. By
              downloading the Application or using the Services you explicitly agree that we may associate your
              Advertising ID and your Advertising Identifier with your applicable persistent device identifier. This
              will facilitate our ability to improve your personalized experience. Further, we may use other persistent
              identifiers for non-advertising purposes. If your device does not have Advertising ID or Advertising
              Identifier respectively, we will use other identifiers.
