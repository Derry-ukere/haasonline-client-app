                Did you know that Dogecoin (DOGE) was intended as a joke? The creators made DOGE as a mechanism to
                enable users to tip each other for fun social media content. Despite the fact that DOGE set off on a
                whimsical foot, it’s become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies out there.

                When it comes to mining DOGE, the fastest and most profitable way to do so is using ASIC-driven
                hardware, a rig that uses application specific integrated circuits or ASICs. You also need to be a
                member of a DOGE mining pool. In short, you need three basic things in order to start mining Dogecoins:

                list some below The right software configuration Mining Dogecoin can be profitable There are a couple of
                reasons why mining Dogecoin instead of another coin is a good idea. First, transactions on the Dogecoin
                blockchain happen quickly so it means that DOGE mining pools tend to make payouts every 24 hours.

              <span>
                Over and above quick payouts, you can also rely on consistent revenue from Dogecoin. As a result, mining
                Dogecoin is efficient and profitable – and a good prospect. There are also plenty of markets where you
                can sell your Dogecoin which means that it is worth considering Dogecoin mining to generate a daily
                income for yourself.

                How to mine Dogecoin
                <br />
              </span>
              <span>
                DOGE is based on the Scrypt hashing algorithm and for that reason the best way to mine it is using
                something like the Antminer L3++ as this device makes use of ASICs. Furthermore, you should seriously
                consider joining a mining pool when mining DOGE coins because it is simply the best way to maximise
                profits.

              </span>
              <span>
                What does it mean to join a mining pool? It’s simple really: you add your mining power to a group of
                other people’s mining capabilities so that collectively you can achieve a higher hash rate – which means
                that it becomes quicker to solve the problems that lead to a crypto block award. In contrast, mining a
                single block on your own can take months or even years which means you will wait a very long time for
                any kind of reward, and you will have costs to cover in the meantime.

              <span>
                There’s a couple of things you need in place to mine Dogecoins. Your internet connection is the first,
                and we’ll suggest that you have uncapped usage on your connection, but make sure you have at least 0.5GB
                per day available. Next, you need a wallet to store your DOGE, you will also use this wallet to cash out
                your Dogecoins. DOGE has a free wallet which you can try, but many wallets support DOGE. So, the four
                things you need are:

                trustworthy crypto wallet which can receive your Dogecoins Other important things you should think about
                Mining Dogecoins effectively and risk-free involve a couple of other complexities. Keep in mind that
                your mining rig will use a lot of power, so make sure your home or facility’s electrical power grid can
                support the power consumption of your mining rigs, particularly if you have several units.

              </span>
              <span>
                Because your rigs will work around the clock you should also account for heat build-up because these
                hardware units can generate a lot of heat. You need to cool your rigs so that you can make sure they
                keep on working 24/7 and to make sure mining performance stays at its maximum. Overheated machines can
                also be noisy.

                The planning guide to follow will explain what you need to do to deal with the potential power, heat and
                noise issues generated by ASIC mining rigs. One other thing: the lower your latency is on your internet
                connection, the better your mining rigs will perform – you’ll be able to notify the blockchain of a
                solved block faster, so a competing miner won’t accidentally beat you to claiming a solved block.

                Recently, ASIC mining hardware was released which is able to mine coins using the Scrypt algorithm, that
                includes Dogecoin. Amongst your current options we think Bitmain Antminer L3++ is really your best
                option because it offers a good balance between electricity consumption and hashing power – and of
                course, price. In comparison the BW L21 has a low hash rate and also uses less power but the price is
                far higher for this ASIC rig.

                Because you are mining DOGE with an ASIC rig you don’t need to worry about tricky software downloads and

                You should have a look at the popular DOGE mining pools and weigh up how these pay out rewards, what the
                fees are for mining and also make sure the payment method suits you. Some of the best pools include
                Aikapool, BlockMasters and Multipool. Once you’ve picked a pool you can go to the mining pool webpage
                and create workers, if the pool requires it.

                One way to find the IP address for your mining rig is to access your router – look in the DHCP list and

                Alternatively, download the rig’s IP reporter tool to your computer, this should show you a window where
                you can trigger a search – in turn, the tool will report what the IP address of your mining rig is. Of
                course, this method will only work if your mining rig is on your local network.

                price you pay for your cloud mining contract.

                It depends on your mining hardware, but by example the BW L21 can hash at 550 megahashes per second,
                which means you can mine one DOGE in less than an hour.

                Well, work out if the money that you get from selling the DOGE you earn will cover the costs of mining

              <span>
                Billy Markus (from Portland in Oregon) created a coin which he hoped will be fun and easy to access.
                Since then, Dogecoin (DOGE) has achieved a big market cap. Around the same time someone called Jackson
                Palmer was asked by student on Twitter to make the idea popular. Jackson used to work for Adobe Systems
                in Australia, but as a side project decided to buy the domain dogecoin.com, adding some basic website
                elements.

                Markus heard about it and the two decided to push Dogecoin, which was derived from Luckycoin – on its
                own a version of something called Litecoin. Dogecoin is based on the Scrypt algorithm and DOGE was
                released on the 6th of December in 2013, quickly becoming a sensation.

                Dogecoin is a fun project – from the whimsical plans behind the coin through to its mascot, a Shiba Inu.
                It’s no wonder it has become a sensation on the internet – and it also brings solid opportunities to
                make profits by mining it.

                Jackson Palmer and Billy Marcus worked together to launch Dogecoin, but the credit for creating DOGE is
                given to Billy Marcus. Over time the DOGE team is trying to make Dogecoins even more accessible and even
                more fun – the idea is to make it more widespread than Bitcoin.

                The DOGE hashing algorithm
                <br />
              </span>
              <span>
                Litecoin and Dogecoin uses the same algorithm for hashing – it is called Scrypt, a result of the SHA-256
                hard fork of BTC. Appearances are the Scrypt is in fact both more efficient and also works more quickly
                than the BTC hashing algorithm.

                The mining block time for DOGE is just about one minute, while the network difficulty is much less than
                it is for Litecoin – which is 2.5 minutes block time – and of course 10 minutes in the case of Bitcoin.

                Interestingly, when you mine DOGE you can do it at the same time as mining Litecoin. Litecoin is
                arguably more stable and has a bigger role in the cryptocurrency market than DOGE, so you hedge your
                bets, in effect. Mining DOGE and LTC simultaneously can maximise your mining income.

                It is likely that DOGE will incur a hard fork sometime soon. A new project on Ethereum called Rinkeby
                will be using DOGE as a test asset – it’s cause a lot of chatter in the cryptocurrency sphere. The
                expectations is that something called Dogethereum (DOGX) is going to separate from DOGE’s original chain
                at some point.

                There has never been a hard fork of DOGE, this will be the first one and the plan is to make an
                alternative cryptocurrency which will be even faster than DOGE for processing transactions, while also
                making use of smart contracts which runs on Ethereum’s blockchain. Users of DOGE and investors in DOGE
                are rethinking the value of DOGE as a results.
